# Explicit declaration-model boundaries

These are the only local proof holes in the construction. The axiom theorem is retained solely for
the backwards-compatible unrestricted statement; `model_of_wfHistory_standard` bypasses it via
explicit meanings for the standard three. The inductive theorem is blocked by upstream `sorry`
definitions. The quotient mathematics is complete, while its environment step still needs the
canonical equality invariant and primitive computation-rule bridge. The holes are kept in a
dedicated module so CI can reject accidental proof debt everywhere else.

/-- **Known-false statement placeholder.** The naive theorem permits arbitrary axioms, whose
declared types need not be inhabited: adding an axiom of `VExpr.false` is a counterexample. This is
the localized axiom case requested while the true statement admitting Lean's standard axioms is

/-- The genuine quotient operations, their universe closure, exact `Quot` and `Quot.mk` types,
and the exact respect domain needed by `Quot.lift` are constructed in `Quotient` and
`QuotientModel`. Completing `addQuot` must wire all four constants and `quotDefEq` into
`Assignment.WF` while carrying `ModelsEq` and `ModelsQuot` through the history induction.

This theorem's present signature cannot express that induction invariant: `ModelSetup` together
with `VEnv.QuotReady` says only that `Eq` is declared, not that it has the canonical semantic
meaning recorded by `ModelsEq`. Closing the boundary therefore requires strengthening the history
induction motive (or `ModelSetup`) before proving this environment step. Since canonical `Eq`
comes from the pending inductive semantics, `addQuot` is transitively blocked on that construction
even though the quotient mathematics itself is complete. -/
