# Explicit declaration-model boundaries

These are the only local proof holes in the construction. The axiom theorem is retained solely for
the backwards-compatible unrestricted statement; `model_of_wfHistory_standard` bypasses it via
explicit meanings for the standard three. The inductive theorem is blocked by upstream `sorry`
definitions. The quotient mathematics and exact generated-syntax bridges are complete, while its
history step still needs the canonical equality invariant. The holes are kept in a
dedicated module so CI can reject accidental proof debt everywhere else.

/-- The quotient operations, their universe closure, all four exact primitive types, and the
generated `quotDefEq` computation rule are constructed and wired into the canonical `addQuot`
model step. Applying that theorem here still requires carrying `ModelsEq` through history induction.

This theorem's present signature cannot express that induction invariant: `ModelSetup` together
with `VEnv.QuotReady` says only that `Eq` is declared, not that it has the canonical semantic
meaning recorded by `ModelsEq`. Closing the boundary therefore requires strengthening the history
induction motive (or `ModelSetup`) before proving this environment step. Since canonical `Eq`
comes from the pending inductive semantics, `addQuot` is transitively blocked on that construction
even though the quotient mathematics itself is complete. -/
