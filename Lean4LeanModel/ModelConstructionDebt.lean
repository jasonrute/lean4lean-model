# Explicit declaration-model boundaries

These are the only local proof holes in the stage-8 construction. The axiom theorem is a known-false
placeholder for the forthcoming standard-axiom statement, the inductive theorem is blocked by
upstream `sorry` definitions, and the quotient theorem deliberately postpones a temporary model.
They are kept in a dedicated module so CI can reject accidental proof debt everywhere else.

/-- **Known-false statement placeholder.** The naive theorem permits arbitrary axioms, whose
declared types need not be inhabited: adding an axiom of `VExpr.false` is a counterexample. This is
the localized axiom case requested while the true statement admitting Lean's standard axioms is
being specified. -/

admitted and would be replaced by the genuine quotient construction tied to `Eq`. -/
